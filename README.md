## Introduction
The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately classify these digits.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is 28x28 pixels, and each pixel is represented by a value between 0 and 255, indicating the intensity of the pixel.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
